# Stock-Market-Analysis
In this project we attempt to implement machine learning approach to predict stock prices. 
Machine learning is effectively implemented in forecasting stock prices. The objective is 
to predict the stock prices in order to make more informed and accurate investment 
decisions. We propose a stock price prediction system that integrates mathematical 
functions, machine learning, and other external factors for the purpose of achieving better 
stock prediction accuracy and issuing profitable trades.

There are two types of stocks. You may know of intraday trading bythe commonly used 
term "day trading." Interday traders hold securities positions from at least one day to the 
next and often for several days to weeks or months. LSTMs are very powerful in sequence 
prediction problems because they’re able to store past information. This is important in 
our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.
While predicting the actual price of a stock is an uphill climb, we can builda model that 
will predict whether the price will go up or down.
